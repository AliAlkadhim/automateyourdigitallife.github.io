# *Protect and Automate your Digital Life and Finances*

## *Ali Al Kadhim, March 2025*

## ÿßŸÑŸÑŸáŸÖ ÿ∑ŸàŸÑŸê⁄Ü Ÿäÿß ÿ±Ÿàÿ≠

### Step into these crazy and chaotic times (written in March 2025) with confidence in your digital footprint, bolster yourself against hackers/bots/trolls/MAGAs, automate your finances, and levarage the use of exciting AI tools

This is a periodically-updated E book/blog/video tutorials and in-person lecture series (intended to be given in our house‚Äôs backyard to our close family members using Hadeel‚Äôs projector).

The intended audience is anyone of any skill level in technology/digital things, but it is geared towards the technical beginners of all kinds. Special emphasis is on ESL demographics (and especially Arabic - Arabic subtitles and translations will be available to all posts).

Written instructions will be always available on the blog (eventually ), both in English and in Arabic.

think of this as a modern user manual that you had always wished for but that nobody ever gave you, it can take you from 

The intention is a "shotgun approach" on staying secure and levaraging digital tools and products to their full capability in the easiest and shortest time possible. The chapters will be ordered by their priority/importance as judged by me. Think of it as a user manual to survive and thrive in the AI/digital digital age with the easiest ways.

the topics will be searchable on the website both in arabic and english
